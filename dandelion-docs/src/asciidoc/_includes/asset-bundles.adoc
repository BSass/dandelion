== 3. Assets and asset bundles

=== 3.1. Introducing assets and asset bundles

In web applications, static assets are basically all the JavaScript and CSS files loaded in your HTML pages. Dandelion-Core provides a wider representation of these assets, using _bundles_.

An _assets bundle_, or _bundle_ to simplify the language, is a little more than just a set of assets, because it contains additional information that will be described afterwards.

==== 3.1.1. Definitions

A _bundle_ is defined as follows:

.Bundle definition
|===
|Attribute |Description |Required

|`name`
|Name of the bundle
|Yes

|`dependencies`
|Set of bundles that need to be loaded before this one
|No

|`assets`
|Set of assets that compose the bundle
|Yes

|===

And an _asset_ is defined as follows:

.Asset definition
|===
|Attribute |Description |Required

|`name`
|Name of the asset
|Yes

|`version`
|Version of the asset
|No

|`type`
|Type of the asset, among `js` or `css`, inferred from the extension specified in the location
|No

|`locations`
|Map of location key / location pair that provides information about how to fetch the asset
|Yes

|`dom`
|Desired position in the DOM, among `body` or `head` (by default `body` for JS and `head` for CSS)
|No

|`attributes`
|TODO
|TODO

|===

==== 3.1.2. Possible representations

All assets intented to be used in your web applications need to be known by the framework. For that, you have to create one or more bundles in a declarative approach.

Two formats are supported: JSON and XML.

[discrete]
===== 3.1.2.1. JSON representation

Each bundle is basically a JSON file.

Assume you want to use http://jquery.com/[jQuery] in your web application. One representation could be the following:

[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"jquery",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"jquery",
      "version":"1.11.0",
      "type":"js",
      "locations":{  
        "cdn":"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

In this bundle:

* no dependency is declared
* the `jquery` asset is configured with the `cdn` location key. This key is mapped to a particular asset locator used by Dandelion-Core to know the fetching strategy to use. See more about asset locators (TODO LIEN).

===== 3.1.2.2. XML representation

[source, xml]
----
<bundle>
  <name>jquery</name>
  <assets>
    <asset name="jquery" version="1.11.0" type="js">
      <locations>
        <location key="cdn">//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js</location>
      </locations>
    </asset>
  </assets>
</bundle>
----

<h4>Example with a dependency</h4>
<p>
   The above example of the <i>jquery</i> bundle is quite simple. But now let's consider a new bundle
   for the <a
      href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables jQuery plugin</a>. It could be written as follows:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "datatables",
   "dependencies": [ "jquery" ],
   "assets": [{
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/jquery.dataTables.js"
      }
   }, {
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "css",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/css/jquery.dataTables.css"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   This new bundle is slighlty different. You may have noticed that the
   <i>dependencies</i> attribute is now used and indicates that the current bundle is dependent of
   the <i>jquery</i> bundle. Actually we've just told Dandelion that the DataTables jQuery plugin
   needs jQuery to work.
</p>
<p>
   Little by little, depending on the presence of dependencies, your bundles will form a kind of
   <a href="building-a-bundle-graph/">graph</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiaas">Bundle loading</h3>
<p>
   Once the JSON files written, Dandelion will load them in a particular order, using
   <i>bundle loaders</i>. See the <a href="/dandelion/features/bundle-loaders">bundle
      loaders</a> section for more information.
</p>

=== 3.2. Building a bundle graph

TIP: Pending

Once the application started and all bundles scanned, Dandelion-Core stores them internally as a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[directed acyclic graph] or _DAG_, which is used to implement the relationship of dependency between bundles.

==== 3.2.1. Storage rules

Before building any graph, Dandelion applies some storage rules in order to keep consistency between bundles. These rules are described below.

[discrete]
==== #1 The same asset can't be added twice in the same bundle definition

.Rule #1 broken
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"my-bundle",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"my-asset1",
      "type":"js",
      ...
    },
    {  
      "name":"my-asset1",
      "type":"js",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----

. OK
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"my-bundle",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"my-asset1",
      "type":"js",
      ...
    },
    {  
      "name":"my-asset2",
      "type":"js",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----

IMPORTANT: The uniqueness of the assets is based both on the asset type and on its name. As a consequence, the following configuration is permitted:

. OK
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"my-bundle",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"my-asset1",
      "type":"js",
      ...
    },
    {  
      "name":"my-asset1",
      "type":"css",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----

[discrete]
==== #2 The same location key can't be used twice in the same asset definition

.Rule #2 broken
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"my-bundle",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"my-asset",
      ...,
      "locations":{  
        "cdn":"//cdn1",
        "cdn":"//cdn2",

      }
    }
  }
----

. OK
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"my-bundle",
  "assets":[  
    {  
      "name":"my-asset",
      ...,
      "locations":{  
        "cdn":"//cdn",
        "webapp":"/assets/...",
      }
    }
  }
----

[discrete]
==== #3 Cycles between bundles must be avoided

.Bundle1 definition
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"bundle1",
  "dependencies": ["bundle2"],
}
----

.Bundle2 definition
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"bundle2",
  "dependencies": ["bundle3"],
}
----

.Bundle3 definition
[source, json]
----
{  
  "bundle":"bundle3",
  "dependencies": ["bundle1"],
}
----

IMPORTANT: An exception is thrown as soon as a cycle is detected among your bundles.


<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
   Suppose we have the following bundles available in our application:
   <i>jquery</i>, <i>datatables</i> and <i>bootstrap2</i>:
</p>
<div class="row-fluid">
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "jquery",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "jquery",
      "version": "1.11.0",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>jquery</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle" : "datatables",
   "dependencies": [ "jquery" ],
   "assets": [{
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "js",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/jquery.dataTables.js"
      }
   }, {
      "name": "datatables",
      "version": "1.9.4",
      "type": "css",
      "locations": {
         "cdn": "//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.dataTables/1.9.4/css/jquery.dataTables.css"
      }
   }]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>datatables</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
   <div class="span4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "bundle" : "bootstrap2",
    "dependencies" : [ "jquery" ],
    "assets": [
        {
            "name": "bootstrap2",
            "version": "2.3.2",
            "type": "js",
            "locations": {
                "cdn": "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/js/bootstrap.js"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "bootstrap2",
            "version": "2.3.2",
            "type": "css",
            "locations": {
                "cdn": "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/css/bootstrap.css"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
      <p class="text-center"><i>bootstrap2</i> bundle</p>
   </div>
</div>
<p>
   Note the use of the
   <code>dependencies</code>
   attribute in both <i>datatables</i> and <i>bootstrap2</i> bundles, which implicitly join bundles
   together into an graph.
</p>
<p>
   A graphical representation would look like:
</p>

[graphviz, dot-example, svg]
----
digraph g {
    bootstrap2 -> jquery
    datatables -> jquery
}
----

<p class="text-center">
   <img src="/assets/images/dandelion/asset-bundles-00.png" />
</p>
<p>
   With such a representation, it becomes easy to bring back all the necessary bundles - and thus
   assets - as soon as you request one of them.
</p>
<p>
   For example, as soon as you request the <i>bootstap2</i> bundle, Dandelion will read the bundle
   graph and then return in the right order the following assets:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js</li>
   <li>//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/js/bootstrap.js</li>
   <li>//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.2/css/bootstrap.css</li>
</ol>

<p class="alert alert-info">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
   Note that you can visualize a dynamic bundle graph in your running application using the
   <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode">development mode</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="wiaas">Organizing your bundles</h3>
<p>
   You are totally free to build a bundle the way you want it, e.g. by adding as many assets as you
   want. However, you should take the following considerations into account:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Reduce as much as possible the number of bundles</strong>.
      <ul>
         <li>First for performance concerns, even if the bundle loading phase is very fast.</li>
         <li>But mostly for maintenance concerns. The more bundles you have, the harder the
            maintenance will be over the time.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li><strong>Pay attention to the granularity of bundles</strong>: using only one bundle for all assets of your site would lead to bad consequences:
      <ul>
         <li>it would affect performances, especially if assets are injected into pages whereas they aren't used</li>
         <li>it would become harder and harder to share bundles among multiple pages, causing
            to create a new bundle each time you create a new page, finally leading to the consequences explained in the first point</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ns">Next steps</h3>
<p>
   Now you have seen how to build a graph, let's see how to
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/interacting-with-the-asset-bundles">interact with
      bundles</a>.
</p>   

=== 3.3. Interacting with asset bundles

TIP: Pending

<p>
   Once <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">asset
      bundles</a> written and organized into a <a
      href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/interacting-with-the-asset-bundles/">graph</a>, you're
   done with the configuration part.
</p>
<p>
   Now in order for Dandelion to handle the corresponding assets, you have to include bundles in all
   pages where assets are needed.
</p>
<p>
   Dandelion provides many different ways for this purpose:
</p>
<div class="section-index">
   <ul>
      <li><a href="using-the-jsp-taglib.html"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Using the JSP taglib</a></li>
      <li><a href="using-the-thymeleaf-dialect.html"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Using the Thymeleaf dialect</a></li>
      <li><a href="using-the-api.html"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Using the API</a></li>
      <li><a href="using-the-configuration-properties.html"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Using the configuration properties</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>

==== 3.3.1. Using the JSP taglib

<h3 class="section-title" id="rq">Requirements</h3>
<p>
   First of all, please read the <a href="/dandelion/docs/installation/jsp.html">JSP installation guide</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="mb">Manipulating bundles</h3>
<p>The JSP taglib allows you to manipulate bundles by using both {% refjsp ddl bundle %} and {% refjsp ddl asset %} tags.</p>

<h4>Including one or more bundles</h4>
<p>
   You can use the {% refjsp ddl bundle includes %} attribute to add one or more bundles to the current request.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dandelion:bundle includes="bundle1" /&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Excluding one or more bundles</h4>
<p>
   You can use the {% refjsp ddl bundle excludes %} attribute to remove one or more bundles from the current request.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dandelion:bundle excludes="bundle1" /&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ma">Manipulating assets</h3>
<p>
   You can also manipule assets directly by using the {% refjsp ddl asset %} tag which provides the {% refjsp ddl asset exclude %}
   attribute, allowing you to exclude one or more asset from the asset stack.</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dandelion:asset excludes="asset2" /&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   For example, assuming the following asset stack:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle": "bundle1",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "asset1",
      ...
      }
   }, {
      "name": "asset2",
      ...
   }]
}
</pre>
   Only the <code>asset1</code> will be loaded.
</p>

==== 3.3.2. Using the Thymeleaf dialect

<h3 class="section-title" id="rq">Requirements</h3>
<p>
   First of all, please read the <a href="/dandelion/docs/installation/thymeleaf.html">Thymeleaf installation guide</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="mb">Manipulating bundles</h3>
<p>
   The Thymeleaf dialect allows you to manipulate bundles by using the {% reftl ddl bundle %} attribute.
</p>

<h4>Including one or more bundles</h4>
<p>
   You can use the {% reftl ddl bundle bundle-include %} attribute in any HTML tag to add one or more bundles to the current request.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div ddl:bundle-include="bundle1">
   ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Excluding one or more bundles</h4>
<p>
   You can use the {% refjsp ddl bundle exclude %} attribute to remove one o rmore bundles from the current request.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div ddl:bundle-exclude="bundle1">
   ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ma">Manipulating assets</h3>
<p>
   You can also manipule assets directly by using the {% reftl ddl asset exclude %}
   attribute, allowing you to exclude one or more asset from the asset stack.</p>
<p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div ddl:asset-exclude="asset2">
   ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   For example, assuming the following asset stack:
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "bundle": "bundle1",
   "assets": [{
      "name": "asset1",
      ...
      }
   }, {
      "name": "asset2",
      ...
   }]
}
</pre>
   Only the <code>asset1</code> will be loaded.
</p>

==== 3.3.3. Using the API

<p>
   All <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/introducing-asset-bundles.html">bundles</a> can
   also be accessed using the Dandelion API. This is the way used by current components such as
   <a href="/datatables">Dandelion-Datatables</a> but you could of course make use of the API for
   writing your own component or any kind of extension.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="atbg">Accessing the bundle graph</h3>
<p>
   Each request of your application holds the Dandelion context and thus
   gives access to Dandelion configuration, including the
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle
      graph</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The only requirement is that you have access to the <code>HttpServletRequest</code> API.
</p>
<p>
   You can then access the {% javadoc ddl dandelion-core AssetRequestContext %} object, an utility made available to allow you to interact with
   the bundle graph. See the examples below.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).addBundles(...)</code> allows you to add one or more bundles to the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeBundles(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more bundles from the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeJs(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more JavaScript assets from the current request</li>
   <li><code>AssetRequestContext.get(request).excludeCss(...)</code> allows you exclude one or more CSS assets from the current request</li>
   <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-info">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp;
   Remember that in <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/">development
      mode</a>, the <a
      href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/bundle-graph-viewer.html">bundle
      graph viewer</a> can help you visualizing what bundles are added in
   the current request.
</p>

==== 3.3.4. Using the configuration options

<p>
   Some configuration properties allow you to interact either with bundles or assets but in a
   wider scope than the request.</p>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="iebp">Include/exclude bundles permanently</h3>
<p>
   Sometimes you need to load some CSS files everywhere in your application.
</p>
<p>
   For this purpose, just define the
   <code>bundle.includes</code>
   property in your <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration">dandelion.properties</a> file and
   set all the bundle names you wish to include.
</p>
<p>
   As a consequence, these bundles will be loaded in every request.
</p>
<p>
   And for some reason, if you need to do the opposite, you can exclude bundles from the
   application by using the
   <code>bundle.excludes</code>
   property.
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="ieap">Include/exclude assets permanently</h3>
<p>
   Similarly you can permanently exclude assets from the application. Two configuration properties
   are available:
   <code>asset.js.excludes</code>
   and
   <code>asset.css.excludes</code>
   that allow to exclude JS and CSS files respectively.
</p>

<br />
<p class="alert alert-warn">
   <strong><i class="fa fa-warning fa-2x"></i></strong>&nbsp; 
   Remember that interacting with the
   asset bundles using any of the above configuration properties has a global impact on the
   application.
</p>
