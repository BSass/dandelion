== 13. Debugger

Dandelion comes with a debugging tool that can be especially useful during development.

=== 13.1. Accessing the debugger

In order to access the debugger, append the following request parameter to the current URL: `ddl-debug`.

For example, if you're currently browsing the JSP starter sample at the URL: http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-starter/, just modify the URL as follows: http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-starter/?ddl-debug. 

As a consequence, Dandelion will override the response with the debugger and show information about the current request.

NOTE: access to the debugger can be disabled thanks to the <<opt-tool.debugger, `tool.debugger`>> configuration option.

=== 13.2. Debug pages

The Dandelion debugger is composed of several _debug pages_. Each of them can be browsed using the left menu.

* *Bundles/assets*: reports all bundles/assets included in the current request in different formats
* *Options*: lists all configuration options
* *Cache store*: pending...

Moreover, each Dandelion component can contain additional pages that will be displayed in the same menu.

=== 13.3. Plugging-in custom debug pages
