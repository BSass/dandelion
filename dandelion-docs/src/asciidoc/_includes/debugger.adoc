== 12. Debugger

Dandelion comes with a debugging tool that can be especially useful during development.

=== 12.1. Accessing the debugger

In order to access the debugger, append the following request parameter to the current URL: `ddl-debug`.

For example, if you're currently browsing the JSP starter sample at the URL: http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-starter/, just modify the URL as follows: http://localhost:8080/datatables-jsp-starter/?ddl-debug. 

As a consequence, Dandelion will override the response with the debugger and show information about the current request.

=== 12.2. Dandelion components

Depending on the components being used on the current page, the debugger can contain additional pages.

=== 12.3. Plugging-in custom debug pages
