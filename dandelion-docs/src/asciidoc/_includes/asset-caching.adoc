== 9. Asset caching

=== 9.1. Introducing asset caching

TIP: Pending

You may have seen in the section about <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-locators/introducing-asset-locators.html">asset locators</a> that some of them require caching. Actually caching operates at several levels that we'll see in this section.

==== 9.1.1. Server caching

As soon as a page is requested, Dandelion reads your
   <a href="/dandelion/features/asset-bundles/building-a-bundle-graph/">bundle
      graph</a>, grabs all necessary assets and apply asset processors
   on them.
</p>
<p>
   This is where the first caching pass occurs: as soon as an asset is
   fetched, using its associated locator, the content can be stored in
   the configured cache system, but under certain condition.
</p>
<h4>Production mode</h4>
<p>
   In <a href="/dandelion/features/production-mode/">production
      mode</a>, the content of assets is always cached after
   all enabled processors have processed the assets. This way, assets
   processing is done only once.
</p>
<h4>Development mode</h4>
<p>
   In <a href="/dandelion/features/development-mode/">development
      mode</a>, actually it depends on the locator used to fetch the asset.
</p>
<p>
   Basically, if Dandelion can render the asset directly from its
   source (e.g. with assets coming from the current webapp, or from a
   CDN), the asset won't be cached.
</p>
<p>
   However if the asset comes, for example, from a JAR, Dandelion
   will generate direct link if your servlet container allows it
   (Servlet API >3.0). If not, the asset will be cached.
</p>

==== Cache key
<p>
   Each asset that must be cached has an associated cache key defined as follows:
</p>
<p>
   <strong>[SHA1_generated_from_the_current_URL]/[asset_name]-[asset_version].[asset_type]</strong>
</p>

<h3 class="section-title" id="rc">Request caching</h3>
<p>
   The second pass of caching occurs as soon as all assets requested by
   a page are fetched and processed.
</p>
<p>
   At this moment, Dandelion will store the association
      between the request and all the corresponding assets into the
   configured cache system.
</p>
<p>
   <img src="/assets/images/dandelion/cache-request-assets.png" style="margin-top:20px;" />
</p>
<h4>Cache key</h4>
<p>
   These assets are stored under a simple cache key which corresponds to
   the current request's URI with potential request parameters appended.
</p>

==== 9.1.2. Browser caching

=== 9.2. Built-in server-side cache systems

TIP: Pending

==== 9.2.1. Memory

Dandelion uses the _MemoryAssetCache_ service provider as the default implementation used for server-side caching.

|===
|Cache name|`default`
|Service provider|_MemoryAssetCache_
|===

This implementation contains one map for asset caching and another one for request caching. The max element of each of them can be configured thanks to the <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration/#main-cache.asset.max.size">cache.asset.max.size</a> TODO and <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration/#main-cache.request.max.size">cache.request.max.size</a> TODO configuration properties.

==== 9.2.2. Ehcache

Alternatively, if you already use http://ehcache.org/[Ehcache] in your application, it can be handy to use it as a main cache system for Dandelion.

The _dandelion-ehcache_ extra brings:

* a new service provider for the _AssetCache_ SPI
* a dependency to the http://ehcache.org/[Ehcache] project


|===
|Cache name|`ehcache`
|Service provider|_EhcacheAssetCache_
|===

===== 9.2.2.1. Installation

<p>
   {% assign artifact = 'dandelion-ehcache' %} 
   {% include build-tools.html %}
</p>
<p>
   Once the artifact available in your classpath, you need to tell
   Dandelion that you want to use the service provider bundled inside.
</p>
<p>
For that, you just need to add the following configuration to your <code>dandelion.properties</code> file:

 cache.name=ehcache

===== 9.2.2.2. Configuration

Dandelion comes with some configuration properties that allow to configure the Ehcache extra.

The first one is <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration/#main-cache.configuration.location">cache.configuration.location</a> which allows to specify the location of the <code>ehcache.xml</code> file.

The second one is <a href="/dandelion/docs/ref/configuration/#main-cache.manager.name">cache.manager.name</a> which allows to specify the name of the cache manager to use to manipulate the cache.

=== 9.3. Plugging-in your own cache system

TIP: Pending

   As all other parts of the framework, Dandelion provides an extension point allowing you to
   plug-in your own cache system. Read more
   <a href="plugging-in-your-own-cache-system.html">here</a>.

You may wish to use a custom cache system. Let's see here how to proceed.

<h3 class="section-title" id="sac">SPI for asset cache</h3>

In order to plug-in your own cache system, just follow these steps:

* Create a class that extends {% javadoc ddl dandelion-core AbstractAssetCache %}

[source, java]
----
package com.foo.asset.cache.impl;

public class MyCacheSystem extends AbstractAssetCache {

   @Override
   public void initCache(Context context) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public String getCacheName() {
      return "myowncachesystem";
   }

   @Override
   public String getAssetContent(String cacheKey) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public Set&lt;Asset&gt; getRequestAssets(String cacheKey) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public void storeAssetContent(String cacheKey, String assetContent) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public void storeRequestAssets(String cacheKey, Set&lt;Asset&gt; assets) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public void remove(String cacheKey) {
      ...
   }

   @Override
   public void clearAll() {
      ...
   }
}
----

* In the `META-INF/services` folder, create a text file (UTF-8 encoded) using the following convention:

[source, xml]
----
yourJar
|__ src
   |__ main
      |__ resources
         |__ META-INF
            |__ services
               |__ com.github.dandelion.core.asset.cache.spi.AssetCache
----
   
Inside this file, just add the fully qualified name of your own implementation. For example:

 com.foo.asset.cache.impl.MyCacheSystem

* Tell Dandelion to use your custom implementation thanks to the <<opt-cache.name, `cache.name`>> configuration option.

 cache.name=myowncachesystem


And that's all! Thanks to the SPI mechanism, Dandelion will automatically pick up your implementation on the next server restart.
